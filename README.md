# Arduino-Smart-Lights
Uses Arduino to automatically turn on lights when a person enters a room.

This project attempts to use Arduino to create a model for smart lights. The program counts the number of people that enter a room and exit the room, and automatically turn off the lights when there are no people in the room.

Required Parts:
- Arduino Uno (x1)
- Full or Half size Breadboard (x1)
- PIR Motion Sensor (x2)
- Dupont Wires (>25)
- Light/Lamp (with a switch preferably) (up to 2 max)
- Relay (x1)

Required Software:
- Arduino 1.8.5 (Minimum)

Note: This is not a professional project and thus may not be fully functional all the time. It works best when the area of the room (inside and outside) is generally not crowded.
